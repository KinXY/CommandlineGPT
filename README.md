## This project is a command-line wrapper for OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API. It is designed as a python practice for the author.

This project implements all the features of chat.openai.com, including chatting, preserving multiple histories, variations during the chat, and keeping a tree-structure chat history.

To build the project from source, you need to have python installed and new a file named `config.json` in the root directory of the project. The file should contain the following content:
### {"api_key" : "your_key_here"}
Then you just need to run "python app.py" in the root directory of the project.
